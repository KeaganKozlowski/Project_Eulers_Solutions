# Project Euler Problems and Solutions
### What is Project Euler?
Project Euler is a website dedicated to a series of challenging mathematical and computer programming problems that require more than mathematical insights to solve. They often involve the development and implementation of efficient algorithms and clever problem-solving techniques.
### But why this?
Personally I really enjoy doing puzzles and difficult problem-solving questions. As I believe it can strengthen myself and prepare me thoroughly for real life scenarios where it might prove useful to understand.

However, I also believe that if people are able to understand and solve a problem that they previously thought was impossible by understanding my thought process I believe that is very beneficial.

From these various problems I hope that you begin to understand and use my technical understand to improve yourself, which could lead to you getting a job or nailing an interview.
### How will I do this?


### What languages will be available
For this repo I will try and write every solution in Python, Java and C++.

However, since Python is the language I prefer to use it might take time for me to implement other languages.
